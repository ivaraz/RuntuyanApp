# RuntuyanApp


**RuntuyanApp** is a sophisticated, modern, and fully responsive to-do list web application designed to provide a seamless and intuitive task management experience. The name "Runtuyan" is Sundanese for a harmonious sequence, reflecting the app's goal to help users organize their daily tasks into a smooth and logical flow.

The application allows users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks, with all data persistently stored in the browser's local storage. Its standout feature is a dynamic dashboard that provides users with real-time statistics and a visual representation of their progress, which adapts beautifully across all device sizes, from mobile phones to laptops.

### Technologies Used
   - **HTML5:** For the core structure and semantic layout of the application.

   - **CSS3:** For all styling, including layout, responsive design using Flexbox and Media Queries, and animations.

   - **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, data management, and interaction with Local Storage.

   - **Font Awesome:** For modern and clean icons used throughout the user interface.

### Features
+ Full CRUD Functionality:

  + **Create:** Add new tasks with automatic capitalization and a timestamp.

  + **Read:** View the list of tasks, which are loaded from local storage on startup.

  + **Update:** Edit existing tasks seamlessly using the main input form. Mark tasks as complete by clicking the checkbox or the task text itself.

  + **Delete:** Remove individual tasks from the list.

+ Persistent Data Storage:

  - All tasks are saved to the browser's Local Storage, ensuring that the user's data is preserved between sessions.

+ Fully Responsive Design:

  - Mobile-First: A clean, single-column layout optimized for small screens.

  - Desktop/Tablet: A two-column layout that appears on larger screens, placing the dashboard and input form on the left and the task list on the right for an enhanced productivity view.

+ Interactive Dashboard:

  - Date & Time Widget: Displays the current date to provide daily context.

  - Task Statistics: Real-time counters for Total, Pending, and Completed tasks.

  - Visual Progress Bar: A dynamic progress bar that fills up as tasks are completed, providing visual motivation.

  - Filtering: Filter the task list to view "All," "Active," or "Completed" tasks.

  - Clear Completed: A one-click button to remove all completed tasks and tidy up the list.

+ User-Friendly Interface:

  - Timestamps: Each task is automatically timestamped with the date and time it was added.

  - Automatic Capitalization: All new tasks are automatically converted to uppercase for a uniform look.

  - Intuitive Editing: A smooth editing experience that reuses the main input form instead of disruptive pop-up alerts.

  - Clean Navbar & Footer: A professional layout with a branded navigation bar and a copyright footer.
